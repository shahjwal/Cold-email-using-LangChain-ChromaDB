# Cold Mail Generator
A cold email generator designed for service companies, utilizing Groq, LangChain, and Streamlit. This tool enables users to input a company's careers page URL, extract job listings from the page, and generate personalized cold emails. The emails incorporate relevant portfolio links retrieved from a vector database, tailored to the specific job descriptions.

**Imagine a scenario:**

- Nike is seeking a Principal Software Engineer and investing significant time and resources in recruitment, onboarding, and training.  
- XYZ, a software development company, can offer Nike a dedicated software engineer. To initiate this opportunity, Jwal, a business development executive at XYZ, will connect with Nike through a cold email.
